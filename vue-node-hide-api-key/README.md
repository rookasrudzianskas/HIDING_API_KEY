## BACKEND SETUP

For this project you need both, backend and front end running at the same time

You are going to need an api key running too, to run your the application on your app

How to do that: ✍️

    - In the backend folder, rename .env.sample to .env and run all of them
    - generate api key at opeweathermap.com, and add your key
    - to the API key constant to the .env
    - npm install
    - cd to the folder
    - launch backend
    -launch front end
    - Enjoy it
